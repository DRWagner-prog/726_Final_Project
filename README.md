This repository contains the materials for my final project in 625.726 Theory of Statistics II at Johns Hopkins University.

There are three files in this respository. The first, 'dataset.csv', contains the dataset of houses and house prices that I
fit with various regression models (including KISS-GP). The second, 'Project_1D.ipynb', contains the code necessary to
perform the first fit of the four models using just one regressor (hence the name: 1D). The third and final file,
'Project_2D.ipynb', contains the code necessary to perform the second fit of the four models using two predictors.
